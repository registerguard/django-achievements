Roberts (FFG 58) homeported in Mayport, Fla. March 15, 2010.
The Roberts operated under the control of U.S. 6th Fleet and traveled up 
and down the coast, visiting several nations along the way to provide 
military-to-military training and community relations project support. The 
Roberts was able to donate ten pallets of Project Handclasp hygiene and 
recreation items to many children in the countries visited. All of these 
endeavors were in support of Africa Partnership Station (APS) West.
APS is an international initiative developed by Naval Forces Africa to 
strengthen global maritime partnerships through training and other 
collaborative activities in order to improve maritime safety and security 
in the waters off the coast of West Africa. The three focus areas are 
trafficking of drugs from South America thru Africa to destinations in 
Europe, ensuring the efficient movement and security of natural resources 
and anti-piracy.
In addition, the crew was able to participate in the arduous and 
time-honored naval tradition of crossing the equator and the prime 
meridian at the same time and becoming shellbacks.
Worden joined the Navy in September 2004.</field>

        <field type="TextField" name="long_description">Navy Seaman Juan J. Gomez Verduzco, son of 
Martha Y. and Arnoldo Gomez of Springfield, Ore., recently completed U.S. 
Navy basic training at Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes, Ill.
         During the eight-week program, Gomez Verduzco completed a variety of 
training which included classroom study and practical instruction on naval 
customs, first aid, firefighting, water safety and survival, and shipboard 
and aircraft safety. An emphasis was also placed on physical fitness.
         The capstone event of boot camp is "Battle Stations". This exercise 
gives recruits the skills and confidence they need to succeed in the 
fleet. "Battle Stations" is designed to galvanize the basic warrior 
attributes of sacrifice, dedication, teamwork and endurance in each 
recruit through the practical application of basic Navy skills and the 
core values of Honor, Courage and Commitment. Its distinctly ''Navy'' 
flavor was designed to take into account what it means to be a Sailor.
Gomez Verduzco is a 2009 graduate of Springfield High School of 
Springfield, Ore.</field>
